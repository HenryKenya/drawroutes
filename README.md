# Place Autocomplete
The autocomplete service in the Places SDK for Android returns place predictions in response to user search queries. As the user types, the autocomplete service returns suggestions for places such as businesses, addresses and points of interest.
 This project was developed using [Place AutoComplete](https://developers.google.com/places/android-sdk/autocomplete?hl=ru#option_1_embed_an_autocompletesupportfragment).
